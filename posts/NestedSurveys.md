Suppose you want to know the average household income in a city of a million people. You can't ask everyone, so you pick a sample and ask them. The question is: how do you turn answers from a few thousand people into a defensible claim about all million?

This is the core problem of survey statistics, and it has a surprisingly elegant solution — one that requires almost no assumptions about the population being measured.

## The Design-Based Perspective

Most statistical inference assumes something about the data-generating process. Linear regression assumes errors are normally distributed. Bayesian methods assume a prior. But survey statisticians have a different trick available: *they control the sampling process*, so they know its probability distribution exactly.

This is the **design-based** (or **randomization-based**) approach. Instead of assuming the population follows some model, you treat the population values as fixed unknowns and derive your inference from the randomness in *how you sampled*. Your uncertainty isn't about the world — it's about which people you happened to pick.

The key object is the **inclusion probability** $\pi_i$: the probability that individual $i$ appears in your sample. If you know these, you can do a lot.

## The Horvitz-Thompson Estimator

Let the indicator variable $I_i$ be $1$ if individual $i$ is included in the sample, so $\pi_i = E[I_i]$. Let $\breve{y}_i = y_i / \pi_i$. In vector form, $\breve{y}$ is a size $n$ vector of the $\breve{y}_i$ in the sample.

An unbiased sample sum estimator is
$$
\hat{t} = \sum_{i \in U} I_i \breve{y}_i
$$
This is known as the *Horvitz-Thompson estimator*. The intuition: if someone had a 10% chance of being sampled and showed up, they probably "represent" about 10 people in the population, so we weight their value by $1/\pi_i = 10$. 

The variance is where things get slightly more involved. Define $\Delta_{ij} = \text{Cov}(I_i, I_j)$. Then:

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{t}) = \sum_{i,j \in U} \Delta_{ij} \breve{y}_i \breve{y}_j = \breve{y}^T \Delta \breve{y}
$$
To estimate this variance from the sample, we divide each $\Delta_{ij}$ by the joint inclusion probability $E[I_i I_j]$, giving $\breve{\Delta}_{ij}$. The estimated variance is then $\breve{y}^T \breve{\Delta} \breve{y}$ — a sum only over observed units.

### Simple Random Sampling

For simple random sampling without replacement (SRS) from a population of $N$, drawing $n$ units:

- $\pi_i = n/N$ for all $i$
- $\pi_{ij} = \frac{n(n-1)}{N(N-1)}$ for $i \neq j$
- $\Delta_{ij} = \pi_{ij} - \pi_i \pi_j$

The variance simplifies to the familiar $N^2 \cdot \frac{1-f}{n} S^2$ where $f = n/N$ is the sampling fraction and $S^2$ is the population variance — adjusted by the **finite population correction** $(1-f)$. When you sample a large fraction of the population, your estimate gets better, and this correction captures that.

## Sampling With Replacement

When units are drawn independently with probability $p_i$ at each draw, the *Hansen-Hurwitz* estimator is:

$$
\hat{t} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{y_i}{p_i}
$$
Each draw yields an unbiased estimate of the total, and you average $n$ of them. The variance estimator is just the sample variance of the $y_i / p_i$ values. This is simpler to compute because the draws are independent — you don't need joint inclusion probabilities.

## Beyond Totals: Taylor Series Linearization

Most quantities of interest aren't linear in the population values. Means, ratios, regression coefficients — they're all nonlinear functions of sums. The standard tool for handling this is **Taylor series linearization**. Say we observe want to compute $f(a)$ where $a = \sum_{i \in U} z_i$ is a vector of population totals of different variables and $z_i$ are the observation vectors from our survey. As long as $f$ is continuous, a consistent estimator is $f(\hat{a})$ where $\hat{a}$ is the vector of component sum estimates.

To get the variance of this estimator, note that $f(\hat{a}) \approx f(a) + \nabla f(a)(\hat{a} - a)$. So $\text{Var}(f(\hat{a})) \approx \text{Var}(\langle \nabla f(a), \hat{a}\rangle)$. We can use $\nabla f(\hat{a})$ to estimate $\nabla f(a)$.

If the underlying $z_i$ were sampled without replacement, we could plug in the Horvitz-Thompson estimator as $\hat{a}$ to get

$$
\text{Var}(f(\hat{a})) \approx \text{Var}\left(\nabla f(a)^T \sum_i \breve{z}_i\right)
$$

This is the variance of a different sum, giving $g^T \breve{\Delta}g$ where
$g = \langle \nabla f(T), \breve{z} \rangle$.

If the $z_i$ were sampled *with* replacement, we could plug in the Hansen-Hurwitz estimator to get

$$
\text{Var}(f(\hat{a})) = \text{Var}\left(\nabla f(a)^T \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \frac{y_i}{p_i}\right)
$$
Once again, this is the variance of a sum, which we already know how to compute!



## Regression-Assisted Estimation

Sometimes you have auxiliary information: population totals of covariates that aren't available at the unit level in the sample. Regression-assisted estimation exploits this.

You want to estimate $s^T \beta$ where $\beta = T^{-1} t$ is the population regression coefficient, $T = \sum_{i \in U} x_i x_i^T$, $t = \sum_{i \in U} x_i y_i$, and $s = \sum_{i \in U} x_i$ is the known population covariate total.

- We know $s = \sum_{i \in U} x_i$. So we can estimate the total with
  $f(T, t) = s^T\beta$ using sampling estimates $\hat{T}$ and
  $\hat{t}$.
- For variance, use Taylor approximation and drop the constant
  intercept:

$$
\text{Var}(f(\hat{T}, \hat{t})) \approx \text{Var}( \langle \nabla f(T, t), \begin{bmatrix} \hat{T} - T & \hat{t} - t \end{bmatrix} \rangle )
$$

- Matrix calculus gives $\nabla_t f = s^T T^{-1}$ and
  $\nabla_T f= -T^{-1}(st^T)T^{-1}$

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle \nabla f(T, t), \begin{bmatrix} \hat{T} - T & \hat{t} - t \end{bmatrix} \rangle &= s^T T^{-1}(\hat{t} - t) - s^T T^{-1} (\hat{T} - T)T^{-1}t\\
&= s^T T^{-1} ((\hat{t} - t) - (\hat{T} - T)\beta )\\
&= s^T T^{-1} ((\hat{t} - T\beta) - (\hat{T} - T)\beta)\\
&= s^T T^{-1}(\hat{t} - \hat{T}\beta)\\
\end{align*}
$$

Simplifying further requires us to think about which estimators we're using for $\hat{T}$ and $\hat{t}$. 



## Regression Without Replacement

If we've been sampling *without* replacement, we can use the sampling approximations $\hat{T} = X^T\Pi^{-1}X$ to $T = \sum_{i \in U} x_i x_i^T$ and $\hat{t} =X^T\Pi^{-1}y$ to $t=\sum_{i \in U} x_i y_i$. Substitute this into the variance expression to get

$$
\text{Var}(f) = \text{Var}(s^T T^{-1}X^T \Pi^{-1}(y - X \beta))
$$

The term in the $\text{Var}$ expression is just a Horvitz-Thompson sum estimate of population values $g_i = s^T T^{-1} x_i(y_i - x_i^T\beta)$. We know that's $g^T \breve{\Delta} g$. We can use $\hat{T}$ to approximate $T$ here.

## Regression With Replacement

If we've been sampling *with* replacement, we can use the sampling approximations $\hat{T} = X^TP^{-1}X$ to
$T = \sum_{i \in U} x_i x_i^T$ and $\hat{t} =X^TP^{-1}y$ to
$t=\sum_{i \in U} x_i y_i$ where $P_{ii} = np_i$.

If you squint a bit, you'll see that this is just the variance of the Hansen-Hurwitz sum estimator on population values $h_i = s^TT^{-1} x_i(y_i - x_i^T\beta)$. 




## Multi-Stage Cluster Sampling

Here's where things get genuinely interesting, and where most survey software starts to strain.

Real surveys rarely sample individuals directly. You might first sample counties (making them *primary sampling units* or PSUs), then sample households within those counties. This is two-stage cluster sampling, and the nesting can go arbitrarily deep: counties → blocks → households → people.

Let $I_i = 1$ if cluster $i$ is selected at the first stage, and let $\hat{t}_i$ be the estimated total within cluster $i$ from the second stage. The overall estimator is:

$$
\hat{t} = \sum_{i \in \text{PSU}} I_i \frac{\hat{t}_i}{\pi_i}
$$
This is unbiased by linearity. For its variance, apply the law of total variance:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Var}(\hat{t}) &= \text{Var}(E[\hat{t} | I]) + E[\text{Var}(\hat{t} | I)] \\
&= V_I\left[\sum_{i \in \text{PSU}} I_i \frac{\hat{t}}{\pi_i}\right] + E_I\left[\sum_{i \in \text{PSU}} I_i \frac{\text{Var}(\hat{t})}{\pi_i}\right]
\end{align*}
$$

The first term is the variance of the without-replacement estimator over $\hat{t}_i$ values. The second term is the with-replacement estimator of the sum of the cluster variances. We already know how to compute each of these!

This recursive structure extends naturally to any depth of nesting. Three-stage sampling? The within-cluster variance is itself computed via a two-stage formula.

## Taylor Series Estimates with Clustering

For nonlinear estimators like ratios, the same decomposition applies via Taylor linearization. The gradient $\nabla f$ filters through to weight the cluster-level sums, and everything falls out cleanly.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Var}(E[\hat{t} | I]) &= \text{Var}_I(\langle \nabla f, \hat{a} \rangle) \\
&\approx \text{Var}_I(\langle \nabla f, \sum_{i \in \text{PSU}} I_i \frac{\hat{z}_i}{\pi_i} \rangle) \\
&= \text{Var}_I(\sum_{i \in \text{PSU}}I_i \langle \nabla f, \frac{\hat{z}_i}{\pi_i} \rangle)
\end{align*}
$$

This is the variance of the without-replacement estimator over $\langle \nabla f, \hat{z}_i$ values.

$$
\begin{align*}
E[\text{Var}(\hat{t} | I)] &= E[\text{Var}(f(\hat{a} | I)] \\ 
&\approx E[\text{Var}(\langle \nabla f, \hat{a} \rangle | I)] \\ 
&= E\left[\sum_{i \in \text{PSU}} \frac{I_i}{\pi_i} (\langle \nabla f, \text{Var}(\hat{z}_i) \rangle)\right] \\ 
\end{align*}
$$

This is the without-replacement estimator of the sum of $\langle \nabla f, \text{Var}(\hat{z}_i)$ values.



## Enter NestedSurveys.jl

`NestedSurveys.jl` is a Julia package implementing all of the above, currently under active development. The design philosophy is to make the math visible in the code: the hierarchical structure of a multi-stage estimate should be reflected directly in how you write the computation.

The basic building block is a `SampleSum`, which bundles an estimate with its variance. Arithmetic on `SampleSum` objects propagates variance correctly, so you can compose estimates naturally.

For a simple random sample:

```julia
using NestedSurveys

# 500 sampled from a population of 5000
estimate = sum(sample_values, SI(5000))
# Returns a SampleSum with Horvitz-Thompson estimate and variance
```

For two-stage cluster sampling, you nest the calls. This is often easiest within data manipultion frameworks like `DataFramesMeta`. 

```julia
@chain df begin
    @groupby(:county)
    # Stage 1: estimate totals within each county
    @combine(:subtotal = sum(:Burglary, SI(county_sizes[first(:county)])))
    # Stage 2: estimate the population total from county estimates
    @combine(:total = sum(:subtotal, SI(N_counties)))
end
```

The inner `sum` returns a vector of `SampleSum` objects. The outer `sum` sees these and applies the cluster variance formula — between-cluster variance plus average within-cluster variance — automatically.

For ratio estimation, Taylor linearization is built in via automatic differentiation:

```julia
ratio = taylor(z -> z[1] / z[2]) do g
    sum(g([:numerator_col, :denominator_col]), SI(N))
end
```

The `taylor` function takes your nonlinear function $f$, evaluates the gradient at the sample estimates using ForwardDiff, and applies the linearization formula to get the variance. You write the estimator; the package handles the variance.

Regression-assisted estimation uses a formula interface:

```julia
sum(@formula(outcome ~ 1 + covariate), sample_data, pop_totals, SI(N))
```

This fits the design-weighted regression and applies the residual-based variance formula described above.

The package validates against R's `survey` package — the reference implementation in the field — to ensure correctness. For the estimators that are implemented, the output matches.

## Why This Matters

The design-based framework is notable for what it *doesn't* require. You don't need to assume anything about how $y_i$ is distributed. You don't need a model of the population. Your inferences are valid for the specific population you sampled from, based purely on the randomness you introduced when sampling. That's a strong foundation.

For practitioners, the practical implication is that survey weights aren't just a nuisance correction — they're the mechanism by which your sample results become statements about a population. Getting them right, and propagating their uncertainty correctly through nonlinear estimators and multi-stage designs, is what separates defensible estimates from wishful ones.

`NestedSurveys.jl` is working toward making that easier to get right in Julia, with an API that reflects the actual structure of the problem rather than hiding it behind opaque weight adjustments.
